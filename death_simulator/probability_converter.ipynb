    "# Indexed Liklihood and Probability Converter\n",
    "This script converts the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) `occupational_hazards_data.csv` dataset into an index of likelihoods to die by each occupation and converts the Center for Disease Control (CDC) `deaths_age_gender_race_mechanism_cause.csv` dataset into annual probabilities of death by age, gender, and race.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `death_simulator.py` script has a function which accepts the user input for birthdate (converted to age in days), gender, race, and occupation (as well as other unused inputs). These inputs are used to subset to the relevant rows of data from the CDC and BLS datasets. Next, the annual probabilities are converted into daily probabilities of dying by age (in days), gender, and race this is modulated by the indexed probability of dying by occupation. Dice rolls are made for death on each day and if death happens, then a weighted probability roll is done to determine the specific mechanism and cause of death. If timer permits, the mechanism of death probability will be modulated by the occupation."
